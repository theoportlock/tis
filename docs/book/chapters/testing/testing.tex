\chapter{Testing}
\section{Chapter introduction}
This chapter will focus on some of the more well known problems that face current machine learning models. 
As opposed to traditional testing nomenclature in software design (unit testing, integration testing), I will refer to all forms of experimentation as testing (such as Turing testing).
