\chapter{Abstract}
In our lives, we try to make decisions that increase the possiblity of a moral outcome.
We judge others by their moral objectives and their adherance to them.
Identifying, understanding, and mitigating the flaws of human thought process and decision making is essential for human progress.
Despite much progress made in the field of artificial intelligence, a tool that makes better, more informed moral decisions than a human has not been developed and is the aim of this study.
A novel approach that involves the field of combinatorics to bitarray datastreams with a likeness to the neuronal communication in the brain was developed to achieve these ends.
The possibility of succeeding is incalcuable but increases with effort, time, and expertise.
However, if good progress towards these aims are made, the consequences will pave the way for the future of a more moral society.
