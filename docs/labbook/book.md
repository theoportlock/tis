# Input
Important to have a way of dealing with time
	this could be using a plus one matrix
		could reduce the number of possible combinations by slicing here
		on memory also?
	thous could be using delay
		could be on the memory also
Ramdom input rather than fixed combination?
	resembles more the brain but does it capture enough

# Memory
Important to look at relative combinations (multiply for scaling and addition for sliding)

# Action
Needs to have random component 
Random activation from combination of memory
	in addition to the random action without?
	How to manipulate/decide permenance of random action?
	
# Performance metric
Need a way to visualise and measure the success of all components
	Sum of matrix
	beta distribution between memory arrays
	alpha diversity also

# Testing
Need a continuous source of input and output
Stocks
robotics

# Recruitment
Selling the three node model
