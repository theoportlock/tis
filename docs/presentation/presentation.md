# 
In our lives, we try to make decisions that increase the possibility of a moral outcome.
As humans, we are imperfect moral agents constrained by our biology.
Overcoming these limitations should be the aim of any individual.
One method of overcoming our flawed moral decision making process is to design a tool that will adhere to stated moral principles with a greater discipline than us.

# Project aims
The aim of this study is to leverage the advancements of computing to create a system that will make more moral choices than those made by a human.
Current attempts have fallen short at achieving these ends and resulted in hyperspecific reward seeking behaviour.
