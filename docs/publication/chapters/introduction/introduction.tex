\section{Morality}
Morality is the set of priciples used by individuals that define right and wrong actions.
A moral agent is an individual that acts within a moral system.
An event is concidered moraly virtuous (good) with respect to a moral system if its consequences increase the probability of a moral end.
An event is concidered moraly reprehensible (bad) with respect to a moral system if its consequences decrease the probability of a moral end.
A moral system can contain multiple ends but often, a combination of these ends weighted by personal importance can be assumed to be an end in of itself.

\subsection{Majority moral opinion}
Moral ends vary between individuals.
When individual moral agents interact, one of three possible combinations can be observed.
Firstly, a mutual rejection of moral systems can be defined as the assumption of one anothers actions are bad. 
Secondly, an unbalanced interaction is a consequence of the willingness of only one moral agent to encourage the others persuit of their respective moral system.
Lasty, a mutual acceptance of moral systems is the understanding that the ends described by a moral system is aligned to the point that their continued actions weighted by their estimated probability is similar to those actions taken by the moral system of another individual.
As with the legal system, an estimation of common "good" is necessary for collective arbritration of an action.
Once a consensus is established, the application of the golden rule, the principle of treating others as you wish to be treated, forms the idea of justice and social contract.
The search for this consensus is done at a personal scale during adolesence, or at a collective scale when we vote, polls, or protest.
Communication of intention can often be reciprocal, that is to say one individual has and understanding of the others understanding of your understanding and so on.
An understanding of the consequences of breaking this rule encourages the enforcement of a social contract

\subsection{How morality changes}
% A couple of case studies (slavery, womens/gay rights etc.)
% Conjecture and refutation
% Judgement of people from different timepoints
% time dependant moral graphs
% axiom pca plot
Consensus morality changes over time.
Moral opinions can be changed with varying probabilities.
The only means of moral re-evaluation is through the revelation of inconsistencies.
This can be due to incomplete data relating to a moral question or cognitive dissonance.
