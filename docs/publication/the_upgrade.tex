\chapter{Abstract}
In our lives, we try to make decisions that increase the possiblity of a moral outcome.
We judge others by their moral objectives and their adherance to them.
Identifying, understanding, and mitigating the flaws of human thought process and decision making is essential for human progress.
The aim of this project is to create a tool that will make better, more informed moral decisions than a human.
The possibility of succeeding is incalcuable but increases with effort, time, and expertise.
However, if good progress towards these aims is made, the consequences will pave the way for the future of a more moral society.
