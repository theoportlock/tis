How morality changes over time	documents/publication/chapters/introduction/introduction.tex	/^Morality is the set of priciples derived by humans that distinguish between right and wrong actions. An action is concidered moraly virtuous (good) if its consequences increase the probability of achieving a desired end. These ends vary between individuals. As it is with the legal system, an estimation of common "good" is essential for the arbritration of an action. Having a consensus of shared values permits also the use of the golden rule; the principle of treating others as you want to be treated, the basis of which forms the idea of justice. The search for this consensus is done at a personal scale during adolesence, or at a collective scale when we vote, complete polls, or protest.$/;"	u

Project aims	documents/proposal/proposal.tex	/^Morality is the set of priciples that distinguish between right and wrong actions. An action is concidered "good" if its consequences increase the probability of achieving a desired end. These ends vary between individuals. As it is with the legal system, an estimation of common "good" is essential for the arbritration of an action. The search for this consensus is done at a personal or a collective scale when we vote, poll, or protest. The ability to change a moral system comes only from identifying inconsitencies within it. As a consequence, shared values are refined over time. $/;"	s
Project aims	documents/recruitment/recruitment.tex	/^In our lives, we try to make decisions that increase the possiblity of a moral outcome. As humans, we are imperfect moral agents restrained by the shackles of our biology.  As it is with the legal system, an estimation of common "good" is essential for the arbritration of an action. The search for this consensus is done at a personal or a collective scale when we vote, poll, or protest. Any Artificial General Intelligent (AGI) system should adhere to the consensus morality of the time which it exists. Current attempts have fallen short at achieving these aims and resulted in hyperspecific reward seeking behaviour.$/;"	s

Significance of research	documents/recruitment/recruitment.tex	/^Separate from traditional neural network architectures, Hirachical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a technique developed by Numenta that more closely resembles the connections between axons in the brain. In this study, the guiding principles of HTM combined with a novel system for self validation will be designed to evaluate \\emph{ab initio} learning of a new machine learning model. Python will be used principally for development, testing, and validation.$/;"	s
