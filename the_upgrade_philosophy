# current moral framework
An choice is good/moral if an agent believes that the integral of the most probable wellbeing vs time function for a universe in which the action takes place is greater than a universe in which it does not

# the upgrade aim
a choice to create a tool that will make more moral choices

# possibility of creation success
low but increases with: 
	effort - dependent on passion for project
	time - dependent on current occupation
	help - dependent on ability to sell current moral system and justifications for project to others
	expertise - also dependent on current occupation, effort, and time

# possibility of the upgrade to achieve that aim
Humans generally achieve or attempt to achieve this aim. If the tool learns similarly to humans and surpasses their abilities, that trend should continue
