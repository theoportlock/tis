# docs
remake figure for input memory action plan
complete project aims in publication docs

# recuitment
for portlock lab - work on google colab maybe?
need to delegate tasks, best way to be productive

# tis
Work out sparcity - fix the bitarrstats
Make book/guide of figures for tis
Actions like dna transcription
activating things its connected to - work out how to do the "slice memory array with input array for action"
Sort comb by pairs etc
need to focus on finding similar patterns to those observed and working out predictions of missing data (maybe not even missing and just comparing what you see to what you predict - binning memories)
focus on more basic experiments (bit adding etc)
figure out how to change slice of combination search during search
make intracombination priority list for active bit checking
change all functions to yield

# experiment
memory
	abcd_abxd
addition
	calculate sum of two positive integers
textstring
bitstring
big_text
conversation
final_goal
