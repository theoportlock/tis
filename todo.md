for portlock lab - work on google colab maybe?
need to delegate tasks, best way to be productive
Work out sparcity - fix the bitarrstats
Make book/guide of figures for tis
Actions like dna transcription
activating things its connected to - work out how to do the "slice memory array with input array for action"
Sort comb by pairs etc
need to focus on finding similar patterns to those observed and working out predictions of missing data (maybe not even missing and just comparing what you see to what you predict - binning memories)

1. remake figure for input memory action plan
2. figure out how to change slice of combination search during search
3. focus on more basic experiments (bit adding etc)

- complete project aims in publication docs
- make intracombination priority list for active bit checking
- simplify but leave as comment the powerlist - ignore words for now
    - update powerlist until difference between what it sees and predicts is low
    - remove lesser used memories from list
        - percentage certainty/probability cutoff
