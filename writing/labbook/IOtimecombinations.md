# A1A1 / A2A2   
Two paired actions arise at same time. This would happen if two separate activations arose. The activation of another action at the same timepoint might make other activations redundant. Reversable? THINK MORE. Example: difficult to imagine

# A1A2
One action is commonly followed by another. Activation here is a form of muscle memory and makes other activation redundant again. Changes temporal resolution of actions Example: flow mentality - putting toothpaste on brush and raising to mouth

# A1I1 / A2I2
An action and an input at the same timepoint are activated. This could mean that a prior input or action gave rise to the action Example: 

# A1I2
An action could be responsible for this newly observed input. Activation of this is possibly a problem as it could be self validating

# A2A1
A secondary action came after a primary action. THINK MORE

# A2I1
A action came after an input. This could be as a result of the input. Activation could also be an issue with circularity

# I1A1 / I2A2
An input comes at the same time as an action. Activation here is interesting as it would mean to do an action from an input at the same timepoint. Is this important?

# I1A2
An input causes an action. Important to slice here as it is the basis of action choice

# I1I1 / I2I2
Two inputs are remembered simoultaneously. This is the basic premise of input pattern recognition

# I1I2
Same as above except with two timepoints. Activation is the basis of prediction. Example: deciding between two worlds for actions

# I2A1
An output is observed from a prior action. Activation is crucial for action choice also

# I2I1
Two subsequent inputs are remembered. Activation is a way of looking to the past.
