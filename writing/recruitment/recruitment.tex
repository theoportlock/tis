\maketitle

In our lives, we try to make decisions that increase the possibility of a moral outcome.
As humans, we are imperfect moral agents constrained by our biology.
Overcoming these limitations should be an objective that we all strive to achieve.
One method of overcoming our flawed moral decision making process is to design a tool that will adhere to stated moral principles with a greater discipline than us.

\noindent
The aim of this study is to leverage the advancements of computing to create a system that will make more moral choices than those made currently.
The state of the art falls short at achieving these ends and results in hyperspecific reward seeking behaviour.
